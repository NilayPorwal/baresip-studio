        &#8226; Long clicks can also be used to remove calls, chats, messages, and contacts.\n
        &#8226; Call click when callee has not been given can be used for re-dial.\n

        address, the address must be written inside brackets [].\nExamples:\n
        &#8226; sip:foo.com:5060;transport=tls\n

            the call has been established.\n
        &#8226; DTLS-SRTPF means that UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF is offered in outgoing call and that RTP/SAVP,
            RTP/SAVPF, UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVP, or UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF is used if offered in incoming call.\n
        &#8226; SRTP-MANDF means that RTP/SAVPF is offered in outgoing call and required in incoming call.\n
        &#8226; SRTP-MAND means that RTP/SAVP is offered in outgoing call and required in incoming call.\n
        &#8226; SRTP means that RTP/AVP is offered in outgoing call and that RTP/SAVP or RTP/SAVPF is used
            if offered in incoming call.\n
        &#8226; None means that media encryption is not supported and that media transport protocol
            thus is RTP/AVP.

        available addresses. If left empty (factory default), baresip listens at port 5060 of
        all available addresses.
